The following folder contains the assignment for week 06.

Given:

In this assignment, you are going to use text mining to predict the rating of a dress from online reviews.

Objective

Predict whether dresses reviews are positive (>3 stars) or neutral/negative (<4 stars). Write a Jupyter Notebook report documenting your investigation.

We are using the Women’s E-Commerce Clothing Reviews data set (Links to an external site.). 
Note that the full data set is included, but we are running a model on the reviews of dresses only.

Included in your Jupyter Notebook.

  -Explain briefly in your own words how the bag-of-words model and Naïve Bayes work, and how they work together.
  -Pre-processing steps (don’t forget to filter out all non-dress reviews).
  -The head() of the resulting dataframe.
  -Text pre-processing steps resulting in a document-feature matrix.
  -Split the file into a training and a test set.
  -Train a Naïve Bayes classifier predicting whether a review is positive (>3 stars) or neutral/negative (<4 stars).
  -Evaluate the performance of your model on the test set.
  -Check out 3 cases where your model is off target. Inspect the associated texts. Do you understand why your model trips up? Explain.
  
Please provide a link to your Notebook on GitHub . Make sure the GitHub folder includes the data file so the Notebook runs without problems.
